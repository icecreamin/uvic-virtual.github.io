# iGEM Submission VR Experience

Collaborate at the forefront of digital and bio technology with UVic Virtual and Victoria iGEM - your local virtual reality and genetic engineering university teams. We are working together to build a VR program that will make the invisible visible - a model of genetic replication and protein transcription you can interact with in a computer generated world. This project will be featured in Boston in October 2019 at the annual iGEM Jamboree - a collegiate competition that draws competitors from top universities worldwide.
